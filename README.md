# About

cyberintern libwww is a standard library for the cyberintern's WWW workgroup, including protocol implementation and core utilities, and written in Zig. Designed to be fully compliant with specifications, the goal of this work is to build an easily and reliably extensible core for future systems and programs, in a way which doesn't lose its simplicity and understandability. A library which can be trusted.

This work is part of the Cybernetic Internationale initiative, which aims to light the way for a better tomorrow.
